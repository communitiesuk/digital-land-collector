Under the provisions of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 data was collated by English Heritage into ‘A List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest’. Later amended and re-issued as the ‘Second List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest’ and subsequent various ‘Amendment to the Second List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest’. An extract of the above is provided to the council covering its administrative area. Such documents provide the attribution of each entry such that plotting each can be maintained.
