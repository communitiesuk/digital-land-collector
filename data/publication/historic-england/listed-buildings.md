Listed Buildings When a building is recognised as being of special architectural or historic interest it is added to the statutory ‘List’. This is compiled by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) on advice from Historic England. 
 
Buildings on the List are given one of three grades which denote their level of importance, Grade I being the highest and Grade II the lowest: 
 
* Grade I (one) - of exceptional interest
* Grade II (two star) - particularly important
* Grade II (two) - of special interest 
 
Structures that might not be classified as ‘buildings’ - such as railings, gate piers, walls, war memorials, gravestones, post boxes and telephone boxes - can all be Listed Buildings.
