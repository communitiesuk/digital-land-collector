The Government has the power to safeguard the site of any shipwreck in English territorial waters. Historic England manages the licensing scheme that enables access to the wreck sites. It is a criminal offence to interfere with a protected wreck without a licence. Wreck sites are identified as being likely to contain the remains of a vessel, or its contents, which are of historical, artistic or archaeological importance.
