The 'Registerâ€™ of Historic Parks and Gardens was established in 1983, with the emphasis placed on protecting 'designed' landscapes rather than those with botanical importance.  
 
The Register safeguards a broad range of planned open spaces, including public parks, cemeteries, the grounds of private houses, and town squares. Like Listed Buildings, Parks and Gardens are assigned one of three grades to indicate their significance.
