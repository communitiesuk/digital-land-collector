This is a form of ‘temporary’ listing. Local authorities have the power to serve a BPN on the owner of a building which is not listed, but which is of special architectural/historical interest and in danger of being demolished or altered. A BPN lasts for a period of six months and in effect makes an unlisted building subject to the same rules as if it were listed. This allows time for a formal assessment to be carried out.
