Historic buildings and archaeological sites of national importance are given legal protection by being placed on a ‘Schedule’ of monuments. Historic England identifies and advises on these monuments, which are placed on the Schedule by the DCMS. 
 
Examples of Scheduled Monuments are Roman remains, burial mounds, castles, bridges, earthworks, the remains of deserted villages, and industrial sites. Scheduled Monuments can not include ecclesiastical or residential buildings (except for associated caretaker’s dwellings), and unlike Listed Buildings they are not assigned grades.
