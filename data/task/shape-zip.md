The [data-url](field/data-url) field is a link to a [Zip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) archive containing 
at least one file in the [ESRI Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) format.

There should be an accompanying [shape-zip-path](field/shape-zip-path) field containing the path of the archive file with the`.shp` suffix.
